# Project Title:  Using Supervised Machine Learning to Predict Retail Purchase Patterns

OVERVIEW

Retailers across a wide range of industries, small to mega-national, collect anywhere from gigabyte to Exabyte (or even beyond) amounts of data every day. This includes information collected from transactional data, customer demographics, product sales, seasonal purchases etc.

One of the biggest challenges for businesses who perform such collection is discovering co-occurrence relationships in datasets about specific individuals or groups of customers that is both meaningful and actionable (affinity analysis). Hence, the potential for using data collected is often limited either by “small data” (“data iceburg effect”) or is left unexplored. As a result, the intentions and reactions of individual customers can be overlooked.

Therefore, the purpose of this project is to develop a model that would allow a business to predict customer purchase behavior based on variables such as price and purchase frequency. This includes 
Classifying the likely of purchasing a particular product so that the system and suggest the product to the customer. This will help in converting visits into tangible outcomes such as repeated purchases or predicting what products they will purchase. Other goals could include predicting which combination of products would make a customer most profitable; what variables should be addressed to reverse churn; maximizing  cross-selling and up-selling; influencing sales promotions, enhancing loyalty programs;  creating effective store designs,  strategic discount plans;  etc.

To achieve this goal, I plan to use supervised machine learning random forest algorithm to create a model, using data collected about customer behavior from sample Super-Store Dataset from Tableau.  Because customer purchase data is highly sensitive, finding a large dataset with sensible transactions was challenging.  Hence, while this dataset may not be as large as those found in real-world data, its purpose is educational and to serve as a model to manipulate within the time allotted in this project. This model can certainly be expanded and modified for larger datasets and  will tell us how likely a customer is to achieve an outcome, based on what we know about that particular customer.

Creating this model can be broken down into a few key steps:


1]  Form a clear question 	
2]  Gather appropriate data
3] 	Prepare and transform data
4]  Explore the data
5] 	Choose a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest)
6] 	Train, Test and re-evaluate the model
7]  Communicate and Visualize results
